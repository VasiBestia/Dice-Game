# Dice Game 🎲

This is a fun and simple web-based dice game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game simulates the roll of two dice and displays the winner based on which die has the higher number.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for the structure of the webpage
- **CSS3** – for styling the game interface
- **JavaScript** – for generating random numbers and determining the winner

## 🎮 How It Works

- When the user clicks refresh button, the site generates two random numbers between **1 and 6** – representing the roll of two dice.
- The corresponding dice images are displayed on the screen.
- The site compares the two values and shows a message declaring:
  - 🎉 Player 1 Wins
  - 🎉 Player 2 Wins
  - 🤝 It's a Draw

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button (or press spacebar if keyboard support is enabled).
3. Watch the dice roll and see who wins
